# Mini Grocery Order System (Demo Task 1)

This repository contains the full **Mini Grocery Order System** demo, including:

- **Backend (.NET)**: Handles product management, stock validation, transaction-safe order placement, and strict API discipline (only `GET /products` and `POST /orders`).  
  See [Backend/README.md](Backend/README.md) for details.

- **Frontend (Ionic + Angular)**: Minimal UI to list products, place orders, and display success/failure messages using the backend APIs.  
  See [Frontend/README.md](Frontend/README.md) for details.
