# Inventory Allocation System (Demo Task)

This repository contains the full **Inventory Allocation System** demo, including:

- **Backend (Node.js)**: Handles stock validation, order placement, concurrency-safe transactions, and single API usage (`POST /order`). See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for details.
- **React Frontend**: Minimal UI to place orders via the backend API. See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for details.
- **Flutter Frontend**: Minimal frontend for demo purposes, interacts with the same backend API. See [flutter/README.md](flutter/README.md) for details.
